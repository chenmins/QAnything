# What is QAnything?
`QAnything`(**Q**uestion and **A**nswer based on **Anything**) is a local knowledge base question-answering system designed to support a wide range of file formats and databases, allowing for offline installation and use.

With `QAnything`, you can simply drop any locally stored file of any format and receive accurate, fast, and reliable answers.

Currently supported formats include: **PDF(pdf)**,**Word(docx)**,**PPT(pptx)**,**XLS(xlsx)**,**Markdown(md)**,**Email(eml)**,**TXT(txt)**,**Image(jpg，jpeg，png)**,**CSV(csv)**,**Web links(html)** and more formats coming soon…


## Key features

- Data security, supports installation and use by unplugging the network cable throughout the process. 
- Supports multiple file types, high parsing success rate, supports cross-language question and answer, freely switches between Chinese and English question and answer, regardless of the language of the file.
- Supports massive data question and answer, two-stage vector sorting, solves the problem of degradation of large-scale data retrieval, the more data, the better the effect, no limit on the number of uploaded files, fast retrieval speed. 
- Hardware friendly, defaults to running in a pure CPU environment, and supports multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux, with no dependencies other than Docker. 
- User-friendly, no need for cumbersome configuration, one-click installation and deployment, ready to use, each dependent component (PDF parsing, OCR, embed, rerank, etc.) is completely independent, supports free replacement. 
- Supports a quick start mode similar to Kimi, fileless chat mode, retrieval mode only, custom Bot mode.




## Architecture
<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/qanything_arch.png" width = "700" alt="qanything_system" align=center />
</div>

### Why 2 stage retrieval?
In scenarios with a large volume of knowledge base data, the advantages of a two-stage approach are very clear. If only a first-stage embedding retrieval is used, there will be a problem of retrieval degradation as the data volume increases, as indicated by the green line in the following graph. However, after the second-stage reranking, there can be a stable increase in accuracy, **the more data, the better the performance**.

</div>

QAnything uses the retrieval component [BCEmbedding](https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding), which is distinguished for its bilingual and crosslingual proficiency. BCEmbedding excels in bridging Chinese and English linguistic gaps, which achieves
- **A high performance on <a href="https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluate-semantic-representation-by-mteb" target="_Self">Semantic Representation Evaluations in MTEB</a>**;
- **A new benchmark in the realm of <a href="https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluate-rag-by-llamaindex" target="_Self">RAG Evaluations in LlamaIndex</a>**.

### RAG Evaluations in LlamaIndex（embedding and rerank）

<img src="https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding/blob/master/Docs/assets/rag_eval_multiple_domains_summary.jpg">

***NOTE:***

- In `WithoutReranker` setting, our `bce-embedding-base_v1` outperforms all the other embedding models.
- With fixing the embedding model, our `bce-reranker-base_v1` achieves the best performance.
- **The combination of `bce-embedding-base_v1` and `bce-reranker-base_v1` is SOTA**.
- If you want to use embedding and rerank separately, please refer to [BCEmbedding](https://github.com/netease-youdao/BCEmbedding)

## Version 2.0.0 adds detailed optimizations:

* Support front-end configuration API_BASE, API_KEY, text chunk size, output token quantity, context message quantity, etc.
* Optimize the instruction compliance of Bot role settings, each Bot can configure model parameters separately.
* Support creating multiple dialogue windows and saving multiple sets of historical Q&A records at the same time.
* Support saving question and answer records as images
* Optimize the logic of uploading files, parse files and question-and-answer requests independently, uploading files will no longer affect question-and-answer.
* Optimize image size, the compressed size of the old version image is 18.94GB -> the compressed size of the new version image is 4.88GB, reduced to 1/4 of the original size, providing a complete Dockerfile.
* Search optimization, chunks add fragment fusion and sorting, aggregate single document or double document.
* Both the retrieval stage and the question-answering stage embed metadata information to improve the retrieval and question-answering effectiveness. 

### Display of data at each stage:
* Display the upload progress of all files in the knowledge base.
* Display the progress of uploading a single file in the knowledge base, and the time consumed in each stage of the upload.
* Question and answer information statistics, including time consumption at each stage of question and answer, token consumption, model information, etc.
* User information statistics, including total number of uploaded files, total time consumed, question and answer history records, etc.

### Problem fixed
* The xlsx file format supports parsing multiple sheets.
* Optimize the problem of missing recognition of PDF tables.
* Fix some parsing errors in DOCX files.
* Optimize FAQ matching logic.
* Support for non-UTF-8 encoded txt files. 

## Comparison of New and Old Parsing Effects
* First, with regard to the parsing of large tables in documents, especially tables that span multiple pages, version 2.0 has made significant improvements. The new version's parsing logic can analyze the structure of the table, including the layout of rows and columns, and can automatically identify the table headers, placing them at the top of each table segment that is split. This improvement prevents interruptions in meaning caused by logical segmentation when parsing long tables.

* In addition, version 2.0 has also been optimized for handling text columnation and cross-page layout. It can recognize double-column or multi-column layouts of text and correctly divide text blocks in accordance with human reading habits. At the same time, this version can also save images in documents to ensure the integrity of content is not lost during file parsing. As shown in the figure below, the correct arrangement should be to group the text arranged in sequence as 1, 2, 3 into a large paragraph and then segment it, rather than segmenting 1, 2, 3 separately.
  * In version 1.4 parsing results, the cross-page text "higher" was chunked into the next text block, which is detrimental to large model semantic understanding. In version 2.0 parsing results, it is correctly divided, and images interspersed in text paragraphs are also parsed into corresponding chunk statements. Non-main text such as "Figure 1 Identification and Authorization and Their Support Relationship 37" and "Cover Story Cover Feature" were successfully filtered out.

* Version 2.0 has also made corresponding optimizations for parsing tables interspersed between text columns or text blocks. The parsing of the original version could not recognize tables and would only parse them in the format of text paragraphs. This not only destroys the logical structure of the tables but also adds a section of messy and useless text for large models, which would affect the accuracy of large model responses. Version 2.0 can recognize and parse these tables embedded in the text, thereby improving the quality of parsing and the accuracy of responses from large models.
  * In version 1.4 parsing results, tables interspersed in text blocks are parsed as normal text blocks. In version 2.0, this type of table can be parsed "elegantly", which not only improves the quality of parsing but also increases the accuracy of large model answers.
  * In addition, in version 2.0, when processing text under specific subheadings, priority is given to ensuring that these texts are segmented into the same chunk block to maintain logical coherence. When the text is too long and needs to be split, the parsing logic of version 2.0 will repeat the same subheading before each split text block to indicate ownership. For example, in the example, the same subheading "European Conference: Legal Status of Robots" was added to all three text blocks (due to the length of the text, this title was not displayed in the original file screenshot). This processing method effectively avoids the problem of incoherent semantic logic in split text blocks caused by excessively long text.

* For Excel (.xlsx) documents with complex formatting, version 2.0 has undergone a series of optimization measures to accurately identify and process row and column data, including optimized handling of merged cells and text spanning across rows or columns. Specific examples can be seen below.
  * In version 1.4, there may be some limitations when parsing Excel documents, especially for documents with special structures or formats. The parsing results may not be satisfactory, mainly recognizing only the plain text part. This may lead to information loss or format disorder when dealing with complex data and formats. In contrast, version 2.0 has significantly improved parsing capabilities, able to better handle various complex formats of Excel documents. Although it may not be perfect yet, it can already solve the vast majority of complex situations.

* Similarly, for simple formatted xlsx documents, version 2.0 of the parser has been optimized.

* In the latest version, we have also made significant improvements to the URL parsing function. Taking the following page as an example, the old version may miss a large amount of page information during the parsing process and cannot effectively handle more complex page elements such as tables and lists. However, the new version has been optimized for these issues and can parse these contents more accurately.

* In addition, for the vast majority of files, version 2.0 has also made corresponding optimizations, including but not limited to the following points.
  * Improved the cutting logic of chunk blocks, avoiding semantic blocks being too short or logic interruption due to blank lines or paragraphs in the document, ensuring the coherence and integrity of text blocks. 
  * The new version can more accurately identify the subheadings in the document, and locate and organize the corresponding text blocks based on these subheadings, which helps optimize the parsing effect, making the parsing structure clearer and the information hierarchy more distinct.
  * The comparison of the analysis results is as follows: In version 1.4, the parsing logic divides the document into 10 chunks, while in version 2.0, after parsing, there are only 4 chunks. The more reasonable and fewer chunk blocks greatly improve the coherence and integrity of the content, helping to reduce semantic breaks or logical confusion caused by improper segmentation, thereby improving the overall parsing and model answering effects.

### In summary, version 2.0 parsing has optimized many aspects compared to version 1.4 parsing, including but not limited to
1. By using more reasonable chunk lengths, the semantic and logical losses caused by paragraphs being too small or incomplete are reduced. 
2. Improved recognition ability for columned text, able to intelligently determine reading order, even correctly handling paragraphs that span across pages. 
3. The new version can recognize and save images and tables within text paragraphs, ensuring that no important text information is missed. 
4. Optimized table parsing, including parsing and storage of long tables exceeding chunk limits and complex structured xlsx files. 
5. Based on the identified subheadings in the document, locate and organize corresponding text blocks to make the parsing structure clearer and the information hierarchy more distinct. 
6. Optimized parsing results for webpage URLs, converted to .md format. 
7. Support for more encoding formats of txt files and docx files.
